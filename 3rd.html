        <p>
            Primary energy sources take many forms, including nuclear energy, fossil energy -- like oil, coal and natural gas -- and renewable sources like wind, solar, geothermal and hydropower.<br> These primary sources are converted to electricity, a secondary energy source, which flows through power lines and other transmission infrastructure to your home and business.
